        content: `React Hooks are a set of functions that allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class. They were introduced in React 16.8 and have since become a standard for handling state and side effects in functional components. The most commonly used hooks are useState and useEffect.`,

        content: `The useState hook lets you add state to your functional components, while useEffect is used for managing side effects such as fetching data or subscribing to events. Understanding these hooks is essential for modern React development, as they simplify component logic and improve code readability.`,

        type: "text",
        content: `Hooks provide a more direct API to the React concepts you already know, such as state and lifecycle methods. By using hooks, you can write cleaner and more modular code, making it easier to manage and test. Additionally, hooks make it easier to share logic between components without changing the component hierarchy, enabling more reusable and maintainable code.`,

        type: "text",
        content: `To fully leverage hooks, it's important to understand their rules and best practices. For example, hooks should be called at the top level of your component and should not be called conditionally. Following these guidelines ensures that hooks work consistently and predictably.`,
